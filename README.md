# Daybar

### See your agenda, and launch Zoom and Google Meet calls from your macOS menu bar.

Daybar's keeping an eye on your calendar and making it easy to jump into your next video call.

After you connect with your Google Calendar, it'll grab your day's events, recognize Zoom and Google Meet links, and stash them all one click away.
